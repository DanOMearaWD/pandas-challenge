# Pandas Challenge

This project involved analyzing data from 15 schools within a single district using Pandas. The data was provided in two `.csv` files located in the **Resources** folder.

## Project Overview

In **PyCitySchools/main.ipynb**, I conducted an analysis of student performance across the 15 schools in the district. The key findings from my analysis include:

- Overall, most students succeeded in both math and reading, but pass rates varied significantly between schools, ranging from **53% to 91%**.
- A closer examination of the top and bottom five schools revealed a notable trend: **charter schools** consistently demonstrated higher pass rates in both subjects compared to **district-run schools**.
  
Additionally, I analyzed various factors including:

- School spending per student
- Math and reading scores by grade
- School size

However, I found no meaningful correlations among these factors. This led me to conclude that **school type** was the only significant factor influencing student success based on the available data.
