# pandas-challenge

This project involved analyzing data from 15 schools within a single district using Pandas. The data was provided in two .csv files located in the Resources folder.

In PyCitySchools/main.ipynb:

My analysis of student performance across 15 schools in the district revealed that, overall, most students succeeded in both math and reading. However, pass rates varied significantly between schools, ranging from 53% to 91%. A closer examination of the top and bottom five schools highlighted a notable trend: charter schools consistently demonstrated higher pass rates in both subjects compared to district-run schools.

Additionally, I analyzed data on school spending per student, math and reading scores by grade, and school size, but found no meaningful correlations. This led me to conclude that school type was the only significant factor influencing student success based on the available data.
